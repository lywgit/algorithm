# Learning Algorithm


Here I keep a record of related algorithm codes while I am learning them.  

Currently this is just a place holder for the code I write to complete the programming assignments for the Coursera class **Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1** by Prof. Tim Roughgarden durring the period of Sep-Oct 2016 (Note this course has been re-launched as an Algorithms specialization since October 10th, 2016).
